## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** >= 8.3 with extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `fileinfo`, `gd`
- **Composer** >= 2.x — [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)
- **Node.js** >= 20.x & **npm** >= 10.x — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **MySQL** >= 8.x (or MariaDB >= 10.6)
- **Git** — [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

---

## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to get GreenMile running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/greenmile.git
cd greenmile
```

> Replace `your-username/greenmile` with the actual repository URL.

---

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

---

### 3. Set Up Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and update the database credentials:

```env
APP_NAME=GreenMile
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=greenmile       # Your database name
DB_USERNAME=root            # Your MySQL username
DB_PASSWORD=                # Your MySQL password
```

---

### 4. Generate Application Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

---

### 5. Create the Database

Create a new MySQL database named `greenmile` (or whatever you set in `.env`):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE greenmile CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

---

### 6. Run Migrations & Seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create all the database tables and seed them with sample data including default user accounts.

---

### 7. Install Node.js Dependencies & Build Assets

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

---

### 8. Start the Development Server

```bash
composer run dev
```

This starts Laravel's development server, the queue worker, and the Vite dev server concurrently. The app will be available at **http://localhost:8000**.

Alternatively, you can run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Laravel server
php artisan serve

# Terminal 2 — Vite (for hot-reloading)
npm run dev

# Terminal 3 — Queue worker
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
```

---

## 🔐 Default Accounts

After running `php artisan migrate --seed`, the following accounts are available:

| Role         | Email                      | Password   |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Super Admin  | `superadmin@example.com`   | `password` |
| Organizer    | `organizer@example.com`    | `password` |
| Organizer 2  | `organizer2@example.com`   | `password` |
| Organizer 3  | `organizer3@example.com`   | `password` |
| Participant  | *(registered via sign-up)* | —          |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Change these credentials before deploying to production.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test --compact
```

To run a specific test file or filter by name:

```bash
php artisan test --compact --filter=EventTest
```

## ⚙️ One-Command Setup (Optional)

The project includes a `composer setup` script that automates steps 2–7:

```bash
composer run setup
```

> Note: You still need to configure `.env` with your database credentials first.

## 🐳 Docker & Railway Deployment

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build (Node → PHP 8.3 + Nginx + FPM) |
| `docker/nginx.conf` | Nginx server config |
| `docker/supervisord.conf` | Manages nginx, php-fpm & queue worker |
| `docker/entrypoint.sh` | Runs migrations, caches config, starts services |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes dev files from Docker build context |
| `railway.json` | Railway platform configuration |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local Docker testing |

### Deploy to Railway

1. **Push your code to GitHub**

2. **Create a new Railway project** at [railway.app](https://railway.app)

3. **Add a MySQL database** — click **+ New** → **Database** → **MySQL**

4. **Add your Laravel service** — click **+ New** → **GitHub Repo** → select your repo

5. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway's service settings:

   ```env
   APP_NAME=GreenMile
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_KEY=                    # Railway will run key:generate automatically
   APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app

   # Copy these from your Railway MySQL service's "Connect" tab:
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQLHOST}}
   DB_PORT=${{MySQL.MYSQLPORT}}
   DB_DATABASE=${{MySQL.MYSQLDATABASE}}
   DB_USERNAME=${{MySQL.MYSQLUSER}}
   DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQLPASSWORD}}

   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   CACHE_STORE=database
   SESSION_DRIVER=database
   ```

   > 💡 Railway supports **reference variables** like `${{MySQL.MYSQLHOST}}` — use them to auto-link your MySQL service.

6. **Deploy** — Railway detects `railway.json` and builds via the `Dockerfile` automatically.

### Test Locally with Docker

```bash
# Build and start (app on http://localhost:8080)
docker compose up --build

# Run seeders inside the container
docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed

# Stop and clean up
docker compose down -v
```
